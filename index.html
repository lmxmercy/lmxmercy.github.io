Currently, I am a third-year master student at Heilongjiang University, where I’m advised by <a href="https://jsjrj.hlju.edu.cn/info/1969/1526.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Jiquan Ma</a> (and collaborated with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Dinggang Shen</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&amp;user=zX41yC8AAAAJ" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Jing Ke</a>, [Prof. Chunquan Li (https://jsjxy.usc.edu.cn/info/2022/10218.htm), <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations%20user=IPHzmmQAAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;oi=ao" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Hui Cui</a>).</p> <p>I specialize in <em>Medical Image Analysis</em> (especially <strong>Whole Slide Image (WSI) Analysis</strong>), <strong>Computational Pathology</strong>, <strong>Multimodal Deep Learning</strong>, and <strong>Geometric Deep Learning</strong>. My objective is to design and develop trustworthy and effective AI solutions in clinical cancer diagnosis and prognosis.</p> <p>During my master studies, I have developed multiple methods for computational pathology from various angles such as patch / slide‑level histopathology image classification, survival outcome prediction, and multimodal feature integration. At present, I primarily focus on the following research topics: <strong>Weakly/Self‑Supervised Learning</strong>, <strong>Multimodal Deep Learning</strong>, <strong>Geometric Deep Learning</strong>, <strong>Knowledge Distillation</strong>, and <strong>Foundation Models</strong>, etc. in medical image analysis, particularly those in computational pathology.</p> </body></html>
