Hi Folks! Currently, I am a third-year master student in Computer Science at Heilongjiang University, where I'm advised by [Prof. Jiquan Ma]([https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/](https://jsjrj.hlju.edu.cn/info/1969/1526.htm)) (and collaborated with [Prof. Dinggang Shen]([https://minsuk.com/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)),
[Prof. Jing Ke]([[https://minsuk.com/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zX41yC8AAAAJ)), 
[Prof. Chunquan Li]([https://jsjxy.usc.edu.cn/info/2022/10218.htm)),
[Dr. Hui Cui]([[https://jsjxy.usc.edu.cn/info/2022/10218.htm](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IPHzmmQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao))).

I specialize in Medical Image Analysis (especially Whole Slide Image (WSI) Analysis), Computational Pathology, Multimodal Learning, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. My objective is to design and develop trustworthy and effective AI solutions in clinical cancer diagnosis and prognosis. During my master studies, I have developed
multiple methods for computational pathology from various angles such as patch / slide‑level histopathology image classification, survival outcome prediction, and multimodal learning. Additionally, I also have some experience in the research of other medical images modalities such as diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), digital retinal imaging, and late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE MRI). At present, I primarily focus on the following research topics: Data‑Efficient, Weakly/Self‑Supervised Learning, Multimodal Learning, Interpretability, and Visual Foundation Models, etc. in medical image analysis, particularly those in computational pathology.
