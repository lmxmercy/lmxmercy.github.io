Hi Folks! I am currently a third-year master student at Heilongjiang University, where I'm advised by [Prof. Jiquan Ma]([https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/](https://jsjrj.hlju.edu.cn/info/1969/1526.htm)) (and collaborated with [Prof. Dinggang Shen]([https://minsuk.com/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)),
[Prof. Jing Ke]([[https://minsuk.com/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zX41yC8AAAAJ))).

My research evaluates large-scale vision-language models like CLIP, ViLBERT, LLaVA, and DALL-E. I enjoy auditing the real-world steps to get these models in production and determining mitigations to help promote fair outcomes. Frequently, this leads to human-centered methods that consider the entire lifecycle of a model: from data collection to deployment.

In addition to research, I am also the Co-President of OSU's [AI Graduate Student Association](https://www.aigsa.club/), where I organize social and professional events for our AI community and run the [AI Application Support Program](https://www.aigsa.club/aiasp/) to provide application advising assistance to underrepresented people applying to graduate school.
