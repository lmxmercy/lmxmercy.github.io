Hi Folks! Currently, I am a third-year master student at Heilongjiang University, where I'm advised by [Prof. Jiquan Ma](https://jsjrj.hlju.edu.cn/info/1969/1526.htm) (and collaborated with [Prof. Dinggang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Prof. Jing Ke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zX41yC8AAAAJ), [Prof. Chunquan Li](https://jsjxy.usc.edu.cn/info/2022/10218.htm), [Dr. Hui Cui]([https://jsjrj.hlju.edu.cn/info/1969/1526.htm](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=IPHzmmQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate))).

I specialize in **Medical Image Analysis** (especially **Whole Slide Image (WSI) Analysis**), **Computational Pathology**, **Multimodal Deep Learning**, and **Geometric Deep Learning**. I aim to design and develop trustworthy and effective AI solutions in clinical cancer diagnosis and prognosis. 

During my master studies, I have developed multiple methods for computational pathology from various angles such as patch/slide‑level pathological image classification, survival outcome prediction, and multimodal feature integration. At present, I primarily focus on the following research topics: **Weakly/Self‑Supervised Learning**, **Multimodal Deep Learning**, **Geometric Deep Learning**, **Knowledge Distillation**, and **Foundation Models**, etc. in medical image analysis, particularly those in computational pathology.
